GOB
===

:code:`GOB` is also a toolbox for benchmarking and comparing global optimization algorithms over a suite of test functions. It provides a standardized framework to evaluate the performance of various optimizers using different metrics. The benchmarking suite consists of a class `GOB` that takes as input a list of optimizers, a list of benchmark functions, a list of metrics, and the bounds for the optimization problems. The `run` method executes the optimization algorithms on the benchmark functions for a specified number of runs and computes the performance metrics.
